# Portugol Projects

A collection of Portugol projects created to practice and improve programming logic skills.

## ðŸ“š About
This repository contains several projects developed in **Portugol**, using both **Portugol Studio** and **Visualg**, with the main goal of learning and practicing programming logic.  
Each project focuses on problem solving and algorithm structuring.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- [Visualg](http://visualg3.com.br/)

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
Each folder contains:
- The **source code** (`.por` or `.alg` files)
- A brief description of the problem
- Example of expected output

## ðŸš€ How to Run
**Using Portugol Studio:**  
1. Install **Portugol Studio** from the [official website](http://lite.acad.univali.br/portugol/).  
2. Open the `.por` file of the desired project.
